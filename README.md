## React Native Technical Test

Thanks for taking your time for assess this submission. This App is developed according to the instructions given for the test. :)

## REST API

I developed the REST API using Nodejs, Express and Mongodb and deployed it on Heroku.
The GitHub repository for the REST API is [here](https://github.com/HiranTharinda/DistrictRESTAPI)

## Installation

If you are using Yarn,

```bash
yarn install
```

If you are using npm,

```bash
npm install
```

You need to create a file named _local.properties_ inside the android folder and add the **location of your android SDK** and a **API key for the Google Maps Platform**.

```bash
sdk.dir=C:\\Users\\wdkhi\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\sdk
GMP_KEY=AIzaSyBNy820ON7pl_W6ODGRrgugRy478zHFwjg
```

To run on Android Emulator or device,

```bash
react-native run-android
```
